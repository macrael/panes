A window manager for os x



* https://koekeishiya.github.io/chunkwm/
* probably the best thing is to learn ameythist first
    * it has most of what i want i think, but is so un-mac-like
* what if I had an app that was just a container for other apps. It showed up in cmd-tab but was a container that had three or four windows in it?
* what I like about amythist is that you can move things around in a pattern
* being able to designate a set of intereseting windows (terminal, sublime, browser) and then have them all where i want them is a lot ofit.
    * bind windows together, so that when one is brought to top, the other is brought to top-1
* two (maybe three? but two almost always...) slots that are re-sizeable, and each on is a tab bar with cmd MRU at least to cycle through other windows.
* ugh, why is nothing good.
* oh god, i want my spaces to have spaces. I want app-tabs and to be able to keep one on one side and switch between two on the other?
* or i want window views. where the same window can be in two spaces.


OK I want to make windowsets.
you can probably pin the to top


Actions (key combos?)
* new windowset
* add window to windowset N
    * frontmost?
    * next window you click on, with highlighting following mouse?
    * press, highlight with mouse, release?
* remove window from windowset N
* arrange windows in windowset N
    * triiiicky. nothing will be as nice as sliding two windows in full screen, but something like it
    * tile other windows other than the one you just touched? other than frontmost?
* swap window in windowset?
* clone windowset
* switch focus w/in the set. crucial.
    * if a set is pinned, you could hijack cmd-tab?
* pin to top -- really? for a single window could be nice, still use the other space. could be clunky.

use highlighting to indicate which windows are a thing, maybe color to indicate set?

I think v1 is just making a set and thing bringing it frontmost when you do the thing

can watch windows for changes. keep track of which one was last frontmost...

Write a test that just loads some window groups on reload.
