x add frontmost window to set
x bring all windows in set frontmost
x make it a set
x remove window from set
x show/fade set indicators
x if one of the windows in the set is currently frontmost, don't fux with that.
x-for now- looks like raise often doesn't do the thing? I have to hit it twice to get it on top... focus first helped.
x break it out of the main config file. (spoon?)
    x break out widowset into its own file
x visual indication of saving a window
* button to cycle through windows (send to back)
    * key to bring set forward
    * key again to send to back of set
    * monitor switch apps and switch windows to reset
    * only cycle if all windows are already raised to be right next to the focused window and the focused window is one of us.
        * This sucks. Send to back SUCKS
            * jumpy
            * cross apps changes the order (raise comes in front/behind where it should.)
        * instead we need a cycle...
        * hit raise
            * we do the bullshit to get everything frontmost. (in the current z order?)
            * then we just start cycling?
            * if you click on a thing, it jumps to the front of the cycle?
                * reset the cycle order if you click on a window?
                    * that's the most annoying part!
                    * but its the only option
                    * am I going to want shift click as well?, probs for reverse.

        * hit raise again

        * is there another way?
        * you hit bring forward, enter a mode
        * you leave the mode if:
            * alt tab to another app
            * cmd ~ to another window (not in the WS? not the next in the WS?
            * in order to faithfully maintain the z order, it's probably best to do the event tapstuff, but i'll start with the slow version.
* use a layout?
* how do we add a window?
	* do a highlight fade when a window is added as a visual feedback that something happened
* change focus to other window(s)
* multiple window sets?
* what happens if you close a window?
	* prob need to watch for that.
* might want to update the list every time you focus a window.
* if the app is hidden it doesn't raise it, have to hit the button twice.
* button to clear the current set.
* should a window set use a window filter as a storage method?


* make hilights work across displays!
* write these functions so that they operate on a set, should carry over to multiple sets.
* One windowset is "active" at a time
	* this lets you bring it frontmost with a click (might be the same number based click that activated it)
	* lets you cycle through those windows
        * could jsut use current z order for focus.
	* some sort of permament hilight is drawn in the window's menubar? or somethign.

* could this swap out windows in a full screen thing?
	* doesn't look like it, rn.

UI
--
* could have a separate menu bar thing for each set
* New set button

* https://koekeishiya.github.io/chunkwm/
* probably the best thing is to learn ameythist first
    * it has most of what i want i think, but is so un-mac-like
* what if I had an app that was just a container for other apps. It showed up in cmd-tab but was a container that had three or four windows in it?
* what I like about amythist is that you can move things around in a pattern
* being able to designate a set of intereseting windows (terminal, sublime, browser) and then have them all where i want them is a lot ofit.
    * bind windows together, so that when one is brought to top, the other is brought to top-1
* two (maybe three? but two almost always...) slots that are re-sizeable, and each on is a tab bar with cmd MRU at least to cycle through other windows.
* ugh, why is nothing good.
* oh god, i want my spaces to have spaces. I want app-tabs and to be able to keep one on one side and switch between two on the other?
* or i want window views. where the same window can be in two spaces.


OK I want to make windowsets.
you can probably pin the to top


Actions (key combos?)
* new windowset
* add window to windowset N
    * frontmost?
    * next window you click on, with highlighting following mouse?
    * press, highlight with mouse, release?
* remove window from windowset N
* arrange windows in windowset N
    * triiiicky. nothing will be as nice as sliding two windows in full screen, but something like it
    * tile other windows other than the one you just touched? other than frontmost?
* swap window in windowset?
* clone windowset
* switch focus w/in the set. crucial.
    * if a set is pinned, you could hijack cmd-tab?
* pin to top -- really? for a single window could be nice, still use the other space. could be clunky.

use highlighting to indicate which windows are a thing, maybe color to indicate set?

I think v1 is just making a set and thing bringing it frontmost when you do the thing

can watch windows for changes. keep track of which one was last frontmost...

Write a test that just loads some window groups on reload.
